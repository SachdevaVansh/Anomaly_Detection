# Anomaly_Detection

Anomaly Detection in Real-Time Data Streams
Overview
This project implements a real-time anomaly detection system for data streams. The system combines multiple anomaly detection algorithms, including Isolation Forest, Seasonal Hybrid ESD (Extreme Studentized Deviate), Autoencoders, and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Autoencoders. The hybrid approach aims to provide a robust and adaptable solution for identifying anomalies in dynamic and evolving datasets.

Algorithm Overview
The hybrid algorithm combines the following anomaly detection techniques:

Isolation Forest: Effective for isolating anomalies in the dataset.
Seasonal Hybrid ESD: Specially designed for time-series data with seasonality.
Autoencoders: Captures complex patterns in the data using neural network-based unsupervised learning.
LSTM Autoencoders: Extends the capabilities of autoencoders to handle sequential dependencies in time-series data.
Installation
To run the code, follow these installation steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git
cd repository
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the code by executing the main script:

bash
Copy code
python your_script_name.py
Replace your_script_name.py with the name of your main Python script.

Code Structure
The code is organized as follows:

your_script_name.py: The main Python script containing the real-time anomaly detection implementation.
requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies required for running the code.
Dependencies
The code relies on the following Python packages:

numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn
tensorflow
Ensure that these packages are installed before running the code.

Customization
The code can be customized for specific use cases:
