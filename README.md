# Anomaly Detection in Real-Time Data Streams

## Overview

This project implements a real-time anomaly detection system for data streams. The system combines multiple anomaly detection algorithms, including Isolation Forest, Seasonal Hybrid ESD (Extreme Studentized Deviate), Autoencoders, and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Autoencoders. The hybrid approach aims to provide a robust and adaptable solution for identifying anomalies in dynamic and evolving datasets.

## Algorithm Overview

The hybrid algorithm combines the following anomaly detection techniques:

- **Isolation Forest:** Effective for isolating anomalies in the dataset.
- **Seasonal Hybrid ESD:** Specially designed for time-series data with seasonality.
- **Autoencoders:** Captures complex patterns in the data using neural network-based unsupervised learning.
- **LSTM Autoencoders:** Extends the capabilities of autoencoders to handle sequential dependencies in time-series data.
